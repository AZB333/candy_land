ABOUT THIS PROJECT
------------------------
The project takes the ideas from the board game Candyland and amplifies them with unique
and interactive qualities. It is a two player game where each player chooses a character
to traverse the board with. The board is composed of tiles, each with a unique twist, and 
with every turn players find themselves in the face of fortune or fear, as the 
everchanging board has many tricks up its sleeve. The main goal for a player is to reach
the castle at the end of the board, therefore winning the game by passing every tile and
defeating the Candyland.
